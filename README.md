kaggle running competetion on titanic survival "https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic". I analysed this data with personal interest to find answers to some of my questions (not really competetion oriented). Analysis and plot done using Python.
Some of the histograms shown in final html report will not run in ipynb, please replace py.sign_in('xxxxxx', 'yyyyyyy') with valid plot.ly keys to run the code.
